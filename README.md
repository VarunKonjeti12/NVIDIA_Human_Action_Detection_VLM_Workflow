# üé• Action Detection with NVIDIA NEVA

This project compares action detection success rates between synthetic and real videos using NVIDIA's NEVA API. It uses Gradio to provide a user-friendly interface for inputting video files and specifying activities to be analyzed. The project calculates detection rates for each video by processing extracted frames.
